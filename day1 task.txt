http/1.1                                     http/2

it compresses data by itself       it uses HPACK for data                                                                    
                                   compression
it usest works onthe textuals     it works on the binary protocal
format                        

it uses requests resource         it uses push frame by server 
inlining for use getting          that collects all multiple 
multiple pages                    pages

http1 performance smaller         http2 uses a more advanced 
then http2                        compression method called
                                  HPACK that eliminates redundant
                                  information in http heater                                                               
                                  packets   



objects and its internal representation in javscript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s
 primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location 
in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
 These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
